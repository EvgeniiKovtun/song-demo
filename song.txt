Soldier of fortune
I have often told you stories
About the way,
I lived the life of a drifter
Waiting for the day.
When I'd take your hand and sing you songs
Then maybe you would say
Come, lay with me, love me
And I would surely stay

But I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound of a windmill goin'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune

Many times I've been a traveller
I looked for something new
In days of old, when nights were cold
I wandered about you
But those days I thought my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here

But I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound of a windmill goin'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune
Yes, I can hear the sound of a windmill goin'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune
