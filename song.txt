Soldier of fortune
I have often told you stories
About the way,
I lived the life of a drifter
Waiting for the day.
When I'd take your hand and sing you songs
Then maybe you would say
Come, lay with me, love me
And I would surely stay

But I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound of a windmill goin'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune
